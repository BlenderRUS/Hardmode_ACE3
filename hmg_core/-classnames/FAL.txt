About-
============
FN FAL, right arm of the free world, designed by the late Diuedonne Saive for Fabrique Nationale in the 1950s. The FAL largely was considered a hit, with the British Commonwealth adopting or manufacturing variants (generally known as the SLR), Brazil, Austria and adopting it as main infantry rifles, and swathes of small contract purchases thoughout it's lifetime. IMBEL continues production of the FAL to this day, effectively unchanged from it's original configuration alongside variants that modernise the platform, and in the civilian realm DS Arms produces FAL and SLR build for the shooter that range from the mundane SLR to Dedicated marksman platforms and the peculiar OSW. 

The SLR in here was actually one of the first things I tried my hand at in Arma modding. No joke I have images from 2 weeks post launch of the Alpha with the SLR in. Kind of pleased with how far even a year brings all this along

Additional Thanks-
============

The HLC/SHARBSE crew for being awesome, tolerant of oddities and allround rad blokes
Kerc Kasha, for answering all my awkward hour config and scripting questions and basicly firing me up to work on Arma stuff. 
Kiory , for working out the 3DS-Oxygen Pipeline. We may have FBX now, but I find .3ds somehow more comforting still. 
"CliffyV" - The FAL IS the best rifle. And you should totally do more Commonwealth shit for Arma man.
SV98- Kudos for the testing.
