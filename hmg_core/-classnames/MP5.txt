About-
============
When it comes to the 9mm Parabellum round, theres really only one weapon family that makes it work for it's keep- the MP5.
Pistol-round SMG variant of the venerable G3 rifle- an SMG so good that it's been in the arms of police and SF unit for half a century now. Everything that the MP5 is can be attributed to it's parented design, but it's longstanding can only be attributed to just how much performance it squeezes out of a pistol round. The M4 may be the new contender for the position of door-banger's choice for it's ability to engage at ranges longer than 150m, but the MP5 more than holds it's own right up to the VERY margin of that line and slightly beyond withit's free-float barrel (only held back by the sheer limitations of the round).
In short, the MP5 eats what you feed it, shoots where you point it, runs how you need it to and breaks down how you'd like it to.

In this pack you get 10 variations of the venerable SMG, from it's most basic as the MP5a2 to the most extravegant as the  MP5/10 and everything in between. Additionally three suppressors are provided. No two of these weapons are identical in performance, weight, or inertia. Very similar, but not the same.
