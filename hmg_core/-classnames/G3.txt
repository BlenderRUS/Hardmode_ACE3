About-
============
The G3's got a long history, the original design concepts originating in the Mauser factories at the end of WW2. The designers moved to spain to work on the design, ultimately producing the CETME Modelo 5, and ultimately moving back to work with H&K once the bar on arms manufacturing in Gemany lifted. 

Classnames-
hlc_rifle_g3sg1		 - H&K G3SG1 (Designated marksman rifle)
hlc_rifle_psg1		 - H&K PSG1 (Sniper Weapon System. So dedcated to the role that the tripod that it mounts to is not integral to the weapon)
hlc_rifle_g3a3		 - H&K G3A3 (Infantry Rifle)
hlc_rifle_g3ka4		 - H&K G3KA4 (Modernised,slightly shorter Infantry rifle)
HLC_Rifle_g3ka4_GL		 - H&K G3KA4 + M203
hlc_rifle_hk51		 - FR Ordnance MC51 (G3 rifle made as compact as an MP5. A Specfic request made by the SAS, apparently 50 made, but none saw combat)
hlc_rifle_hk53		 - H&K HK53 (H&K's formalised solution to the SASR's dilemma, essentially an HK33 made to fit the same size package as the MP5)
hlc_muzzle_snds_HK33	-  Sound Suppressor for the HK53 (and later, the HK33)
hlc_muzzle_snds_G3		-Sound Suppressor for the G3 Rifles (PSG excluded)
HLC_Optic_ZFSG1		- Zeiss Diavari 1.5-6x Rifle Optic in high-profile mount (Modern day as-equivelant to the ZFSG1. Altscope mode uses the Mount's peephole)
hlc_optic_accupoint_g3	- Trijicon Accupoint TR20 Rifle optic in high-profile mount (3-9x, Illuminated post reticle.Altscope mode uses the Mount's peephole)
hlc_20Rnd_762x51_B_G3	 - 20 Round magazine of 7.62x51mm Ball Rounds (i.e, standard bullets)
hlc_20rnd_762x51_T_G3	 - 20 Round magazine of 7.62x51mm Tracer Rounds
hlc_50rnd_762x51_M_G3	 - 50 Round magazine of 7.62x51mm Mixed at a ratio of 1 Tracer for every 5 Standard Ball rounds (X-systems drum mag, so you can have the SAW be interoperable with the rest of the squad.)

The HLC/SHARBSE crew for being awesome, tolerant of oddities and allround rad blokes
Kerc Kasha, for answering all my awkward hour config and scripting questions and basicly firing me up to work on Arma stuff. 
Kiory , for working out the 3DS-Oxygen Pipeline. We may have FBX now, but I find .3ds somehow more comforting still. 
SV98- Kudos for the testing.
