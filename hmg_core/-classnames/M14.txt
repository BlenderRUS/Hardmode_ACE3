About-
============
So the M14 is the big F-You to FN Herstal and the FAL. At it's core, it's more or less just an Auto-fire capable M1 Garand that feeds from external mags instead of en-block clips, for better or worse. of the "Big 3" .308 battle rifles of the era, the M14 is the most cumbersome, but like it's parent design, is a nail-driver. It was so good at it that it well outlived it's immediate successor (the orginal M16) in US Armed force usage. The latest iteration, the Mk14 EBR/M39 EMR platforms though, likely signal the end of it's life , as the adoption of those was primarily decided due to an abundance of mothballed M14s and a distinct lack of 7.62 NATO effectiveness in the current arid conflicts, and M110s and Mk11s were in short supply. 

Classnames-

hlc_muzzle_snds_M14	-Sound Suppressor for the M14 Rifles 
hlc_optic_artel_m14	-  Redfield AR-TEL Optic (3-9x Scope. Sadly, it's impossible in the engine to replicate the locked zoom:zero function)
hlc_optic_LRT_m14	- Leupold LR/T (Effectively the same as the LRPS that's already ingame)
hlc_20Rnd_762x51_B_M14	 - 20 Round magazine of 7.62x51mm Ball Rounds (i.e, standard bullets)

hlc_50rnd_762x51_M_M14	 - 50 Round magazine of 7.62x51mm Mixed at a ratio of 1 Tracer for every 5 Standard Ball rounds (X-systems drum mag, so you can have the SAW be interoperable with the rest of the squad.)

Changelog
============

The HLC/SHARBSE crew for being awesome, tolerant of oddities and allround rad blokes
Kerc Kasha, for answering all my awkward hour config and scripting questions and basicly firing me up to work on Arma stuff. 
Kiory , for working out the 3DS-Oxygen Pipeline. We may have FBX now, but I find .3ds somehow more comforting still. 
SV98- Kudos for the testing.
