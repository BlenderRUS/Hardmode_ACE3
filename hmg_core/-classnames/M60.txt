As set up within ,the M60 comes with one M1913 Rail on the Assembly cover, which makes it compatible with the use of any ASDG_JointRails-compatible optics mounts (even the DMS, though it looks DOPEY AS FUCK)

The HLC/SHARBSE crew for being awesome, tolerant of oddities and allround rad blokes
Kerc Kasha, for answering all my awkward hour config and scripting questions and basicly firing me up to work on Arma stuff. 
Kiory , for working out the 3DS-Oxygen Pipeline. We may have FBX now, but I find .3ds somehow more comforting still.
